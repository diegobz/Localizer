Localizer 1.1.3 (2006/12/13)
============================

Localizer is a Zope product for developers and web masters. Localizer
solves the problem of building multilingual products and web sites,
ranging from internationalization and localization of the user interface
to management of multilingual content.

The 1.1.3 release brings some new features for ZPT. Most important is
the support of interpolation. And now message catalogs are searched for
within the "Localizer" objects, if it exists.

There are also a couple of bugs fixed:

 - The method "LocalPropertyManager.__getattr__" works again.

 - The function "Utils.lang_negotiator" works now when the context
   is not available.

Credits:

 - Mikel Larreategi fixed "LocalPropertyManager.__getattr__".
 - Josef Meile worked on ZPT.
 - Yoshinori Okuji fixed "Utils.lang_negotiator".
