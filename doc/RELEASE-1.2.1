Localizer 1.2.1 (2007/02/12)
============================

Localizer is a Zope product for developers and web masters. Localizer
solves the problem of building multilingual products and web sites,
ranging from internationalization and localization of the user interface
to management of multilingual content.

Fixed a serious regression, with 1.2.0 the Localizer object (used to
customize the language negotiation policy) stopped working. Thanks to
Igor Leturia for pointing out the problem.
