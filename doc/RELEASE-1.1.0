Localizer 1.1
=============

April 11, 2005 - Two years after release of Localizer 1.0, I am
pleased to announce the availability of the next major version,
Localizer 1.1.

Localizer is a Zope [1] product for developers and web masters.
Localizer solves the problem of building multilingual products
and web sites, ranging from internationalization and localization
of the user interface to management of multilingual content.

What's new in 1.1
-----------------

This release brings several new features. Specifically Localizer
now supports industry standards such as TMX [3] and XLIFF [4],
which enhance the interoperability of Localizer based applications
within mainstream environments. 

Native support for 'i18n' namespaces for ZPT (Zope Page Templates)
is included avoiding the need to install other products.

The user interfaces have been vastly improved, specially for
'LocalContent' objects.

Four new translations are available: Danish, Italian, Portuguese
and Russian.

Localizer 1.1 has been re-packaged and now depends on itools Python
package and iHotfix Zope product. While these changes make installation
a bit more complex, the added benefit is simplified source management.
Furthermore this subtle change makes Localizer Services available to
the wider audience of Python [5] developers.

Last but not least, Localizer's stability has been dramatically
improved by resolution of many bugs resulting in a mature and even
more reliable product.
