Localizer is the de-facto standard to build multilingual applications with
Zope. It helps to internationalize and localize Zope products and to build
multilingual web sites through the Management Interface. It deals with
both user interfaces and content.


Requirements

  - Python 2.3.4 or later

  - Zope 2.7.0 or later

  - itools 0.6.x (download from http://www.ikaaro.org/itools)

  - iHotfix 0.5.x (download from http://www.ikaaro.org/localizer)


Installation

  Download Localizer. Unpack the tarball and install it in the "Products"
  directory:

    $ tar xzf Localizer-1.1.X.tar.gz
    $ cp -r Localizer-1.1.0b5 <Zope instance>/Products/Localizer

  Another option, case you are running Unix, is to use symbolic links:

    $ ln -s Localizer-1.1.0b5 <Zope instance>/Products/Localizer
