It would be nice to do for 1.1.0
================================

 * Andy McKay (on Localizer dependencies with itools and iHotfix):

   "You might want to stick a dependency check in __init__.py, Localizer
    fails in confusing manner to users in Zope. It's not broken in the
    Control_Panel, but is if an object exists in the ZMI and its not in the
    drop down list for add products. No error message is generated either."

 * MessageCatalog, sometimes export fails because there is not charset.
   [I believe this one is fixed, check it.]

 * Provide support for domains in the i18n namespace of ZPT. See if something
   else is missing.

 * Test woth Python 2.4

 * Try to solve the problem pointed out by Miguel Perez, see the email.



Things thay may be done sometime in the future (it is a bit of a mess)
======================================================================

 * Use the library libgettextpo introduced in gettext 0.12 to parse the
   PO files, see the docs: "Writing your own programs that process PO files".

 * Develop an API to get messages and translations from the message catalog,
   see email from Pierre-Yves Delens.

 * Bo M. Maryniuck:

   "I can't reproduce the error anymore though I can't send you traceback,
    but I just found, that Localizer crashes Medusa threads if someone else
    object uses "register before traverse". In my case there is an product,
    which is always modifies the request. So if I put there also Localizer,
    you'll never enter the site.

 * (Zope bug) See if something feasible can be done to remove the hardcoded
   use of Latin-1 encoding from Zope and Localizer.

   If not, explain which the problems are and what the developer can
   do (add this as a task for the documentation).


 * When importing a message catalog, should be done something with
   the header? When managing the message catalog through FTP, should
   the header also be editable?

 * François Meehan:

   "Also found that using the import/export function in Localizer/zope
    can bring corruption to the po file, a problem with the accents it
    seems."

 * Document the path where Localizer.changeLanguage sets the cookie,
   which is the path from where it is called, not its physical path.
   See the mails exchanged with Claus Rosenberger. Maybe a FAQ?


User interface (ZMI)
--------------------

 * Complete the help screens.

 * Be sure the framed messages appear in all the management screens every
   time an action is performed, i.e. "Content changed (2002-02-08 15:26)".

 * The "import/export" management screen should allow to import and
   export any language, not only the ones already available in the
   message catalog.

 * Show the languages ordered in the LPM interface (Gari).

 * Add PrincipiaSearchSource


API
---

 * When importing modules from Localizer, either the sort or the long
   way should always be used. Update the documentation to reflect it
   (Rainer Thaden).

   Where the sort form is:

     from Products.Localizer import LocalPropertyManager

   and the long form is:

     from Products.Localizer.LocalPropertyManager import LocalPropertyManager

   See if this can be addressed without compromising backwards compatibility,
   if not document exactly which is the current situation.


Documentation
-------------

 * Add a section "Localizer application anatomy" to the tutorial:

    "One thing you may want to consider is an overview of how a site
     using all the products should be laid out. The examples and guide
     you are providing are very very good and explain all the techcinal
     components of the variouse packages quite well. What seems to be
     missing is a higher level view that ties it all together in terms
     of layout for a demo site.

     An example of a 2-3 language basic site that uses the variouse
     components  would be very attractive for new programs and users
     (moi) and help the adoption of this most excellent product."

  * Re-do the chapter "For Python programmers".

  * Comment about "management_page_charset" to switch the ZMI to utf-8,
    or maybe patch Zope so they're in utf-8 by default.

New features
------------

 * Work on locale information: dates, money, etc..

 * Integrate the File System Message Catalog from CMFLocalizer.

 * Add the ability to manage localized versions of standard files
   in a product: the on-line help system, README.txt, etc..

 * Let to implement ZClasses that inherite from 'MessageCatalog'

 * Set the 'Vary' header.

   The problem is: which value should it have?

   This could allow to remove the patch to Zope for images, if UA
   take care of the 'Vary' header.

 * Implement the whole mapping interface in the Accept classes (Bjorn).

 * Rework 'changeLanguageForm' to support browsers without javascript.

 * Build user management interfaces similar to the ZMI
   (standard_html_header/footer instead of manage_page_header/footer
   and manage_tabs).

 * Improve zgettext to support ZPT, see:
